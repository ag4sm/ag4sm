## Developement Projects

I have a career in Information Technology spanning 20+ years in networking and operating system support.  I have worked on websites using HTML since the late 1990's and have dabbled in development ever since.  During my Masters of Information Technology program, I had to develop a web application based in PHP and MySQL.  At that time, I learned the beauty of CSS.  At that time I also took a course in basic Java object oriented programming and more recently have learned Python and it's uses in Full Stack development.
